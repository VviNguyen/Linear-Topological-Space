ABSTRACT. This thesis investigates the foundational properties of linear topological spaces, focusing on their role in functional analysis and applications. The work begins with fundamental concepts such as neighborhoods and convexity, progressing to structural properties like separation and normality, which underpin the study of topological spaces. Advanced topics, including reflexivity, weak, and weak* topologies, are explored in depth, supported by key results such as the Banach-Steinhaus and Hahn-Banach Theorems. The thesis culminates in an application-driven discussion, highlighting the relevance of these properties in solving non-linear partial differential equations.
